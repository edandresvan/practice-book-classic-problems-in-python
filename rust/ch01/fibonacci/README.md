# Fibonacci Numbers Sequence

In this project, five of the six algorithms explained in the book are provided to generate the Fibonacci sequence for a given number. The Rus program prompts the user to select one of these algorithms:

1. Recursive infinite.
2. Recursive with base cases.
3. HashMap memoization.
4. Cached memoization.
5. Iterative approach.
6. Using a generator (not implemented).

Generators in Rust are still an unstable feature as explained in [this section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/language-features/generators.html) of the beta book.

To run the program use this command:

```shell
$ cargo run
```
