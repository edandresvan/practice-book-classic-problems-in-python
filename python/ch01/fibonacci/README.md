# Fibonacci Numbers Sequence

In this project, six algorithms are provided to generate the Fibonacci sequence for a given number. The Python program prompts the user to select one of these algorithms:

1. Recursive infinite.
2. Recursive with base cases.
3. HashMap memoization.
4. Cached memoization.
5. Iterative approach.
6. Using a generator.

To run the program use this command:

```shell
$ poetry run main
```
